# Task: Implement Docker+gVisor Sandbox

## Date
2025-10-27 12:02 UTC

## Prompt
Continue with Phase 1: Implement the Docker+gVisor sandbox framework

## Actions Taken
1. Starting Phase 1: Proof of Concept implementation
2. Will create Dockerfile.claude-sandbox
3. Will create run-sandbox.sh wrapper script
4. Will test with Projects 1.1 and 1.2

## Files Changed
- `.air/tasks/20251027-1202-implement-docker-gvisor-sandbox.md` - This task file
- `Dockerfile.claude-sandbox` - Container definition (to be created)
- `run-sandbox.sh` - Wrapper script (to be created)

## Outcome
✅ Success

## Summary

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Created `Dockerfile.claude-sandbox` (65 lines)
  - Based on python:3.11-slim
  - Runs as non-root user (claudeuser, UID 1000)
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Pre-installs common packages (pytest, pandas, jinja2, etc.)
  - Health check configured
  
- ✅ Created `run-sandbox.sh` (176 lines)
  - Full-featured wrapper script
  - Configurable resource limits (memory, CPU, pids)
  - Network isolation by default
  - gVisor runtime support with fallback to runc
  - Auto-builds image if missing
  - Colored logging output
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Fixed: Removed -it flags for non-interactive execution

**Testing:**
- ✅ Docker image built successfully
- ✅ Project 1.1 (Hello World): PASSED
  - Python script executed successfully in sandbox
  - Output: "Hello from the sandbox!" + timestamp
- ✅ Project 1.2 (Calculator): PASSED
  - All 5 pytest tests passed
  - Multi-file project works correctly
- ✅ Isolation verified:
  - ✅ Read-only root filesystem (cannot write to /tmp)
  - ✅ Workspace is writable
  - ✅ Container filesystem isolated from host
  - ✅ Network isolation (--network=none)
  - ⚠️ gVisor not installed (using runc fallback)

**Security Status:**
- Process isolation: ✅ Working
- Filesystem isolation: ✅ Working
- Network isolation: ✅ Working
- Resource limits: ✅ Configured
- Syscall filtering: ⚠️ Basic (runc), gVisor recommended

**Next Steps:**
- Install gVisor for enhanced syscall filtering
- Test Projects 2.1 and 2.2
- Test Project 4.4 (escape attempts)
- Cross-platform testing (Windows)

## Notes
Phase 1 implementation following the research in analysis/reviews/sandbox-options.md
Target: Get Projects 1.1 and 1.2 working in isolated sandbox environment
