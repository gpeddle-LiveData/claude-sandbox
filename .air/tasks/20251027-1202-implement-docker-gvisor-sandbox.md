# Task: Implement Docker+gVisor Sandbox

## Date
2025-10-27 12:02 UTC

## Prompt
Continue with Phase 1: Implement the Docker+gVisor sandbox framework

## Actions Taken
1. Starting Phase 1: Proof of Concept implementation
2. Will create Dockerfile.claude-sandbox
3. Will create run-sandbox.sh wrapper script
4. Will test with Projects 1.1 and 1.2

## Files Changed
- `.air/tasks/20251027-1202-implement-docker-gvisor-sandbox.md` - This task file
- `Dockerfile.claude-sandbox` - Container definition (to be created)
- `run-sandbox.sh` - Wrapper script (to be created)

## Outcome
⚠️ Partial - Implementation Complete, Testing Pending

## Summary

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `Dockerfile.claude-sandbox` (65 lines)
  - Based on python:3.11-slim
  - Runs as non-root user (claudeuser, UID 1000)
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Pre-installs common packages (pytest, pandas, jinja2, etc.)
  - Health check configured
  
- ✅ Created `run-sandbox.sh` (179 lines)
  - Full-featured wrapper script
  - Configurable resource limits (memory, CPU, pids)
  - Network isolation by default
  - gVisor runtime support with fallback to runc
  - Auto-builds image if missing
  - Colored logging output
  - Comprehensive error handling

**Pending:**
- ⏳ Docker Desktop installation required
- ⏳ gVisor installation required
- ⏳ Testing with sample projects

**Next Steps:**
User needs to install:
1. Docker Desktop for Mac
2. gVisor runtime (optional but recommended)
3. Then test with Projects 1.1 and 1.2

## Notes
Phase 1 implementation following the research in analysis/reviews/sandbox-options.md
Target: Get Projects 1.1 and 1.2 working in isolated sandbox environment
