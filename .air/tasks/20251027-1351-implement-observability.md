# Task: Implement Observability (Phase 2)

## Date
2025-10-27 13:51 UTC

## Prompt
Continue with Phase 2: Add observability features to the sandbox - structured logging, monitoring, and real-time status viewing.

## Actions Taken
1. Enhanced `run-sandbox.sh` with structured JSON logging
   - Added `log_json()` function to write JSON format logs
   - Logs include: timestamp, event type (start/complete), container name, workspace path, resource limits, command, exit code, duration, success status
   - Fixed JSON format to use single-line entries for easier parsing
   - Log files stored in `logs/` directory with format: `claude-sandbox-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`

2. Created `sandbox-monitor.sh` for real-time container monitoring
   - Interactive interface with commands: [l]ogs, [f]ollow, [s]tats, [i]nfo, [e]xec, [q]uit
   - Shows container status, resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O)
   - Auto-refresh every 2 seconds
   - Lists all claude-sandbox containers if none specified

3. Created `sandbox-history.sh` for execution history viewing
   - Options: `--recent N`, `--failed`, `--success`, `--since DATE`, `--container NAME`, `--json`, `--stats`
   - Displays formatted execution summaries with color-coded status
   - Statistics mode shows: total executions, success/failure counts, success rate, average duration, total runtime
   - Fixed JSON parsing to handle quoted string values for success field

4. Tested all observability features
   - Verified logging with multiple sandbox executions
   - Confirmed history viewer displays executions correctly
   - Validated statistics aggregation

## Files Changed
- `run-sandbox.sh` - Enhanced with structured JSON logging
- `sandbox-monitor.sh` - New real-time monitoring tool (140 lines)
- `sandbox-history.sh` - New execution history viewer (231 lines)

## Outcome
✅ Success

Phase 2 complete! All observability features implemented and tested:
- ✅ Structured logging (JSON format)
- ✅ Resource usage metrics (via monitor)
- ✅ Real-time output streaming (via monitor follow mode)
- ✅ Container inspection tools (via monitor)
- ✅ Execution history tracking
