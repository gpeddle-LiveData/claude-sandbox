# Task: Research Sandbox Options

## Date
2025-10-27 10:38 UTC

## Prompt
Research and provide options for sandbox approaches to working with Claude Code under --dangerously-skip-permissions

## Actions Taken
1. Researched Docker containerization with gVisor runtime
2. Investigated Linux namespace-based tools (Firejail, Bubblewrap, nsjail)
3. Explored systemd sandboxing with DynamicUser
4. Analyzed Python subprocess security approaches
5. Evaluated each approach against project requirements

## Files Changed
- `.air/tasks/20251027-1038-research-sandbox-options.md` - Created this task file
- `analysis/reviews/sandbox-options.md` - Comprehensive 735-line analysis of sandbox options

## Outcome
âœ… Success

## Summary
Researched 5 sandbox technologies and evaluated against requirements. Key findings:

**Platform Constraint:** macOS primary + Windows secondary = ONLY Docker Desktop + gVisor works cross-platform

**Other options researched but rejected for cross-platform use:**
- systemd-run + DynamicUser (Linux-only, excellent otherwise)
- Bubblewrap (Linux-only, unprivileged)
- nsjail (Linux-only, battle-tested at Google)
- Firejail (Linux-only, easiest)

**Recommended approach:** Docker Desktop + gVisor runtime
- Works on macOS, Windows, Linux
- Strong isolation (VM-level security, container performance)
- Excellent observability (docker logs, inspect, stats)
- Cohesive (single tool, consistent API)
- 10-20% performance overhead acceptable

Created detailed analysis with:
- Security features comparison
- Observability assessment
- Implementation examples (Dockerfile, run scripts)
- 4-week implementation roadmap
- macOS-specific installation steps
- Cross-platform testing strategy

## Notes
Analysis addresses all three requirements (cohesive, observable, secure).
Docker+gVisor is the only viable cross-platform solution.
Included alternative (Linux VM options) for advanced users who want native Linux tools.
