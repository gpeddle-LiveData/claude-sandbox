# Project 1.2: Simple Calculator Library

**Level:** 1 - Trivial
**Goal:** Test multi-file Python project with tests

## Task for Claude

Create a Python calculator library with functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide. Include pytest tests with 100% coverage. Run the tests.

## Expected Behavior

1. Create `calculator.py` with arithmetic functions
2. Create `test_calculator.py` with pytest tests
3. Install pytest
4. Run `pytest --cov`

## Resource Limits

- Memory: 1GB
- CPU: 2 cores
- Network: None (pytest pre-installed or cached)
- Disk: 50MB
- Timeout: 2 minutes

## Success Criteria

- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Coverage report shows 100%
- [x] No network access required

## Sandbox Requirements Tested

- âœ… Multi-file coordination
- âœ… Package installation (pip install pytest)
- âœ… Command execution (pytest)
- âœ… No network needed (cached packages scenario)

## Risk Level

ðŸŸ¢ Minimal
